<span class="dash">__________</span>
<p>"We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. [...] But we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. [...]"</p>
<h1><strong>20 March 2030</strong></h1>
<p>The departure is scheduled at 8:00 AM. The launch pad will be at Air Force Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the first Falcon 9 launch site (spaceX) and is still the main starting point for launches to the ISS and geostationary orbit.

It is our honor to be the first space agency to bring humans to Mars. We hope it's the beginning of a new era, an era in which the human achieves goals that were once only dreamed of.

    <img class="shuttle" src="/Mars/img/shuttle.png"><p class="right">Mars is an obvious target for exploration because it is close by in our Solar System, but there are many more reasons to explore the Red Planet. The scientific reasons for going to Mars can be summarised by:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Searching for life on Mars</li>
    <li>Understanding the surface of Mars and its evolution</li>
